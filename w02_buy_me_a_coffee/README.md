# Week 2: How to build a "Buy me a coffee" DeFi Dapp

## How to run

The following script will:

1. compile the contract
2. spin up a local Hardhat node
3. deploy the contract to the local network
4. copy the contract ABI to the frontend folder
5. launch the front-end server (otherwise, you won't be able to connect to the MetaMask wallet)

```zsh
bin/start.zsh
```

Next steps:

1. Configure the `localhost` network in MetaMask
2. connect one of the local accounts to your MetaMask wallet
